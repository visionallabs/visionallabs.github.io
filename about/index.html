          <h2 id="this-is-our-happy-little-story">This Is Our Happy Little Story.</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, in the vast digital landscape of the internet, there existed a small but mighty open-source think tank affectionately known as &ldquo;The Little Open Source Think Tank That Could.&rdquo; Nestled within the bustling hub of innovation, this think tank was a beacon of creativity, collaboration, and community spirit.</p>
<p>At its heart, the think tank was a melting pot of diverse minds, united by their passion for technology and their belief in the power of open collaboration. Engineers, developers, designers, and enthusiasts from around the globe gathered in virtual meeting rooms, exchanging ideas, sharing knowledge, and embarking on ambitious projects together.</p>
<p>Despite its humble beginnings, the think tank dreamed big. It dared to challenge the status quo, to push the boundaries of what was possible, and to make a difference in the world of technology. With boundless enthusiasm and an unwavering commitment to their mission, the members of the think tank set out on their journey, fueled by a shared sense of purpose and a relentless pursuit of excellence. And coffee. A few tanker trucks worth of coffee.</p>
<p>One of the think tank&rsquo;s most remarkable qualities was its resilience. Like the little blue engine in the classic children&rsquo;s story, it faced countless obstacles and setbacks along the way. But time and time again, it rallied together, drawing strength from its collective determination and refusing to be deterred by adversity.</p>
<p>The think tank&rsquo;s projects were as diverse as its members, ranging from innovative software applications to groundbreaking hardware prototypes. Each project was a labor of love, born from the collaborative efforts of passionate individuals who shared a common vision for a better, more open future.</p>
<p>One of the think tank&rsquo;s most celebrated projects was an open-source operating system designed to empower users with freedom, flexibility, and security. Dubbed &ldquo;WirixOS,&rdquo; it quickly gained a dedicated following, attracting contributors from around the world who were eager to lend their expertise to its development.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most remarkable thing about the think tank was not the projects it created or the technologies it developed, but the sense of community it fostered. In an age of increasing polarization and division, it served as a shining example of what could be achieved when people came together with a shared purpose and a willingness to collaborate.</p>
<p>As word of the think tank&rsquo;s work spread, so too did its influence. Gradually, other like-minded individuals and organizations began to take notice, inspired by its ethos of openness, inclusivity, and innovation. Before long, the think tank had grown from a small group of enthusiasts into a global movement, with chapters and affiliates spanning continents.</p>
<p>And so, the story of the little open-source think tank that could serves as a reminder that even the smallest of ideas has the power to change the world. Through collaboration, creativity, and a shared sense of purpose, anything is possible. As long as there are dreamers willing to come together and work towards a common goal, the future is boundless, and the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Now we just have to make it all happen.</p>
